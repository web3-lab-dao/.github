## Welcome to Web3 Lab

Web3Lab is a group of volunteers and technology enthusiasts that empower the Future of Web3. The main technology that Web3Lab is focusing on is the blockchain technology especially the blockchain layer-1 with the high scalability and security such as Aptos and Sui.

## The vision and mission

We do believe that Web3 will be the future of the internet but the transition and mass adoption will not be easy. Our mission is to help people to access Web3 easily and bring Web3 to their daily life.

## How does Web3 Lab work

Web3Lab is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). It’s the network and group of enthusiasts contributing for the Web3 vision. 

Members of Web3Lab can be the developers, researchers, scientists, marketers, investors … regardless of where they come from or what they are working for. The incentive and reward model based on *proof of contribution* (will be updated later) will encourage the members contribution.
Web3Lab will follow the DAO mechanism, but in the initial phase, It will be the semi-DAO

## What we are doing
 - We hold the [MoveTalk](https://blog.web3lab.network/move-talk-03-the-sui-move) event monthly that helps developers and builders learn and build applications on Move based blockchain quickly. 
 - We will have mini-hackathons on Move for developers and students. We aim to build the DevCenter in Vietnam (and APAC) for SuiEcosystem
 - We develop applications on Move based blockchain including the wallet, DAO platform, LaunchPad, DEX, Games …
 - We help projects built on other chains (EVM-based)  moving to Move-based easily
